                <h3>The Blue Nile (Amharic: ጥቁር አባይ, romanized: T’ik’uri Ābayi; Arabic: النيل الأزرق, romanized: an-Nīl al-ʾAzraqu) is a river originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It travels for approximately 1,450 km (900 mi) through Ethiopia and Sudan. Along with the White Nile, it is one of the two major tributaries of the Nile and supplies about 85.6% of the water to the Nile during the rainy season.
